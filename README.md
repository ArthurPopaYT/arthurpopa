# Arthur Popa's Personal Website

This is the personal website for Arthur Popa, built with Next.js.

## Current Status

The website is currently deployed in a simplified version without 3D features due to TypeScript compatibility issues with React Three Fiber and Three.js. The static version includes:

- A clean, responsive design
- Links to social media profiles
- A loading animation

## Planned Development

Future updates will include:
- Interactive 3D universe visualization using Three.js once TypeScript issues are resolved
- Dynamic content loading for portfolio pieces
- Improved animations and transitions

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Development Notes

- The 3D visualization is currently disabled due to TypeScript errors in the integration between React Three Fiber and Next.js.
- TypeScript declaration files have been added to support future 3D development.
- The current deployment uses a static fallback version until 3D rendering issues are resolved.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
